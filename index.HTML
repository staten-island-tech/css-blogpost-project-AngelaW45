      Hello! My name is Angela Wang, I’m currently a Sophomore at Staten Island
      Technical Highschool. I’m 14 years old, turning 15 on October 17, 2007. My
      favorite colors are purple and pink. I enjoy drawing, as well as coding,
      and took realistic still-life art classes in middle school.
    </p>
    <p class="text2">
      I’m currently thinking about joining the stage crew for SING, as well as
      getting involved with more things in school such as more clubs and
      volunteering for things like the freshman social. My schedule is listed
      below, along with my thoughts on my experience so far, feel free to talk
      to me if you have any of the same classes as me! :D (N) (Including
      thoughts on the subjects listed)
