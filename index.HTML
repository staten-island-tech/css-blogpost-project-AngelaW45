    <p class="header-text">
      Hello! My name is Angela Wang, I’m currently a Sophomore at Staten Island
      Technical Highschool. I’m 14 years old, turning 15 on October 17, 2007. My
      favorite colors are purple and pink. I enjoy drawing, as well as coding,
      and took realistic still-life art classes in middle school.
    </p>
    <p class="header-text">
      I’m currently thinking about joining the stage crew for SING, as well as
      getting involved with more things in school such as more clubs and
      volunteering for things like the freshman social. My schedule is listed
      below, along with my thoughts on my experience so far, feel free to talk
      to me if you have any of the same classes as me! :D (N) (Including
      thoughts on the most mintresting subjects in my opinion)

      <h3>3rd- AP computer science principles (Micheal Whalen) (G)</h3>
      <img src="JavaScript-code picture.jpg  alt="Javascript"/>
      <p>
        Mr, Whalen has a sense of humor that you rarely see in teachers, with
        basically no homework at all, unless you're behind on your projects in
        school. That is to say, I’ve been lagging a bit behind with my projects
        because I’m not used to using a computer with all its controls and
        whatnot. But in the end, I do enjoy learning about JavaScript/coding for
        designing websites and such. (N)

      <h3>6th- CAD/Civil Engineer & Architecture (Kaitlin Geraghty) (G)</h3>
      <img src="CAd 2d picturer.webp" alt="CAD"/>
      <p>
        Mrs, Geraghty is a very reliable person, if you have any questions that
        you and your classmates have, you would have no trouble asking her about
        it either after class or after 9th period. Mrs.Geraghty gives us as much
        time as we need to work on the projects in class. I also really enjoy
        the aspect of seeing things in the new 2d aspect for CAD, and am excited
        to work more in both 2d and 3d worlds. (N)

      <h3>9th- Badminton (Amanda Nudelman) (D)</h3>
      <img src="Badminton picture.webp" alt="Badminton" />
      <p>
        Mrs, Nudelman is a kindhearted and compassionate person, who encourages
        everyone to work together, and help each other get better no matter what
        it is that you're doing, In my case, is badminton; she inspires and
        motivates us to always try our best and to always be kind and fair to
        others. (N)
